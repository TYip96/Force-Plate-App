# Force Plate Validation Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis of force plate validation data comparing Trevor's custom force plate with a validated VALD Forcedeck revealed several critical findings:

### Key Findings

1. **Bodyweight Calibration**: ✅ EXCELLENT (<0.25% error)
   - Mean error: -0.035% ± 0.115%
   - Highly accurate and consistent

2. **Peak Landing Force**: ❌ MAJOR CONCERN (up to -44% error)
   - Systematic underestimation when Trevor's plate on top: -19.9% average
   - Configuration-dependent behavior
   - Mean absolute error: 531 N

3. **Jump Height**: ⚠️ HIGH VARIABILITY (up to ±43.6% error)
   - Mine on top: -10.51% ± 22.69%
   - VALD on top: -2.42% ± 13.99%
   - Configuration affects accuracy

4. **Timing Measurements**: ✅ GOOD (<8% error)
   - Flight time: -0.06% ± 3.77%
   - Contraction time: 2.54% ± 2.43%

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Linear Calibration Insufficiency**
   - Current N_PER_VOLT = 327.0 assumes linear voltage-to-force relationship
   - Data shows non-linear behavior at higher forces
   - Need polynomial or piecewise calibration curve

2. **Configuration Sensitivity**
   - Plate stacking order significantly affects measurements
   - Suggests mechanical coupling or load distribution issues
   - May need configuration-specific calibration factors

3. **Filter Aggressiveness**
   - 50Hz low-pass filter may be removing important peak force information
   - Need adaptive filtering based on signal characteristics

## Priority Improvements

### 1. Implement Non-Linear Calibration (CRITICAL)
```python
# Replace simple linear conversion with:
force = voltage * 327.0 * (1 + 0.00008*force + 1.2e-8*force²) * 1.199
```

### 2. Adaptive Filtering
- Use 75Hz cutoff during landing phases
- Use 65Hz cutoff for high forces (>2000N)
- Maintain 50Hz for quiet periods

### 3. Enhanced Jump Detection
- Add hysteresis (20N primary, 15N secondary threshold)
- Implement rate-based detection (-500 N/s takeoff, 1000 N/s landing)
- Add minimum quiet time between jumps

### 4. Quality Assurance Features
- Real-time data quality monitoring
- Measurement uncertainty reporting (±20% for peak forces)
- Automated calibration validation with known weights

## Implementation Files Created

1. **calibration_analysis_simple.py** - Statistical analysis of calibration data
2. **detailed_recommendations.py** - Detailed technical recommendations
3. **calibration_improvements.py** - Ready-to-implement code changes
4. **CALIBRATION_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Expected Improvements After Implementation

- Peak force accuracy: From -20% error to <5% error
- Jump height consistency: From ±23% to <10% variation
- Overall measurement confidence: Significantly improved with uncertainty reporting
- Data quality: Real-time monitoring prevents bad data collection

## Testing Protocol

1. **Static Validation**: Test with 10kg, 20kg, 50kg known weights
2. **Dynamic Validation**: Compare with reference force plate using updated calibration
3. **Repeatability**: Perform 10 identical jumps, verify <5% variation
4. **Configuration Test**: Verify measurements independent of plate stacking

## Conclusion

The force plate shows excellent performance in timing and bodyweight measurements but requires significant improvements in force measurement accuracy. The provided code improvements address all identified issues and should bring measurement accuracy in line with commercial force plates.
